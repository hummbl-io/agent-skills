# Focus Block

Start a structured deep work block with a clear goal, timed duration, distraction logging, and end-of-block review. Based on the Pomodoro technique and Cal Newport's deep work principles. Helps maintain focus and measure productive output.

## When to Use
- When starting focused work on a specific task that requires concentration
- When you need to minimize context switching and track interruptions
- When reviewing how a focus session went and what was accomplished
- When establishing a rhythm of focused work blocks during the day

## Execution
1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for goal description, duration (default: 50 minutes), and action (default: start)
2. For `start`: record the goal, start time, and duration in `_state/focus_blocks.jsonl`
3. Display the goal prominently and set expectations for the block
4. During the block: log any interruptions or distractions as they occur
5. For `review`: calculate time spent, assess goal completion (fully, partially, not met)
6. Record outcome, interruption count, and learnings
7. Suggest optimal next action based on energy and goal completion

## Output Format
