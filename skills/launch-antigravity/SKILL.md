# Launch Antigravity Desktop App

This skill provides a convenient way to start the Antigravity desktop application.
It abstracts the underlying command needed to locate and execute the Antigravity executable,
ensuring the correct environment variables and guardrails are applied.

## When to Use
- When you need to open the Antigravity UI quickly from any agent context.
- When automating workflows that require user interaction via Antigravity.

## Execution Steps
1. Resolve the Antigravity installation directory. By default, it lives under:
   `$env:USERPROFILE\bin\Antigravity.exe`.
2. Verify that the executable exists.
3. Run the executable using a non-interactive shell (PowerShell) with the required guardrails:
   ```powershell
   & "$env:USERPROFILE\bin\Antigravity.exe" --no-interactive-shell
   ```
   The `--no-interactive-shell` flag disables `tools.shell.enableInteractiveShell`
   to avoid crashes in headless sessions.
4. Return a success/failure status.
