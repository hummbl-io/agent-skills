# Assessment Report

Generate a professional governance assessment report from your organization's interactive assessments.

## When to Use
- Client completes one of the your assessment questionnaires
- After a governance audit engagement
- Producing deliverables for consulting clients

## Execution

1. **Collect scores** from assessment questionnaire results
2. **Calculate ratings** per domain (A-F scale)
3. **Structure report**:
   - Executive Summary with overall score
   - Domain-by-domain findings
   - Gap analysis (current vs target state)
   - Risk heat map (likelihood × impact)
   - Prioritized recommendations (P1/P2/P3)
   - Roadmap (30/60/90 day)
   - Appendix: full question-by-question results
4. **Output**: Markdown at `_state/reports/<client>-assessment-<date>.md`

## Output Format

```
