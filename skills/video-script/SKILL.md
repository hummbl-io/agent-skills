# Video Script

Write a complete video script with sections, per-section timing, visual/screen direction notes, and narration text. Supports explainer, tutorial, and promotional styles.

## When to Use
- You are creating a YouTube tutorial or explainer video
- You need a scripted walkthrough with visual direction cues
- You want to plan a promotional video with precise timing
- You need screen recording instructions alongside narration

## Execution
1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for topic, style (explainer/tutorial/promo), and duration (default 5 min)
2. Determine structure based on style:
   - Explainer: hook, problem, solution, how it works, CTA
   - Tutorial: intro, prerequisites, step-by-step, recap, next steps
   - Promo: hook, pain point, demo, social proof, CTA
3. Write narration script for each section with word count (150 words/min pace)
4. Add visual direction notes (screen recordings, slides, animations, b-roll)
5. Include timing markers and transition cues
6. Calculate total duration and adjust pacing if needed

## Output Format
