# Client Report

Generate a periodic progress report for a client engagement by aggregating time tracking data, completed deliverables, milestone status, and upcoming work. Supports weekly and monthly cadences with markdown or PDF output.

## When to Use
- At the end of a billing period to summarize progress
- Before a client check-in meeting to prepare talking points
- When a client requests a status update on their engagement
- For internal review of engagement utilization and velocity

## Execution
1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for client name, period (default: weekly), and format (default: md)
2. Pull time entries from `[time-track]` data for the specified period and client
3. Pull milestone status from `_state/engagements.jsonl` for the client
4. Aggregate: hours worked, deliverables completed, milestones hit, blockers encountered
5. Calculate utilization rate (hours worked vs hours budgeted)
6. Generate the report in the requested format
7. If `--format pdf`, use `[docgen]` skill to render
