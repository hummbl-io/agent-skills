# Bus Forensics

Forensically analyze the coordination bus. Reconstruct what happened across
agents, trace response chains and consensus gates, detect anomalies, and
produce a structured forensic report.

## When to use

- "Audit/analyze/investigate the bus" or "bus forensics"
- "What happened on the bus in the last N hours?"
- "Trace this proposal/lane/PR on the bus"
- "Find anomalies in bus traffic"
- "Who's talking to whom on the bus?"
- "Bus deep scan" / "full analysis"
- Post-incident bus audit (what did agents communicate during an event?)
- Coordination failure investigation (why didn't agent X respond to agent Y?)
- Consensus gate forensic (what happened with proposal Z?)
- Session lifecycle audit (were sessions properly closed?)
- Health daemon pattern analysis (are daemons firing at expected intervals?)

## How it works

This skill uses a hybrid approach:

1. **`scripts/bus_forensics.py`** — a stdlib-only Python script that fetches
   bus entries (via `bus-global.py` bridge or local mirror), parses the TSV
   format with JSON-wrapped message handling, and runs 12 automated analysis
   modules: overview, sender activity, type distribution, timeline, response
   chains, anomaly detection, consensus gates, session lifecycle, coordination
   flow, intel type extraction, host provenance, and health daemon patterns.

2. **This SKILL.md** — guides you through interpreting the extracted data and
   producing a human-readable forensic report.

## Step 1: Run the extraction script

```bash
# Default: last 200 entries, full analysis
python <skill-dir>/scripts/bus_forensics.py

# Time window: last 24 hours
python <skill-dir>/scripts/bus_forensics.py --window 24h

# Specific count
python <skill-dir>/scripts/bus_forensics.py --count 500

# Time range
python <skill-dir>/scripts/bus_forensics.py --from 2026-08-10T20:00Z --to 2026-08-11T01:00Z

# Filter by sender
python <skill-dir>/scripts/bus_forensics.py --agent devin

# Filter by message type
python <skill-dir>/scripts/bus_forensics.py --type PROPOSAL

# Search for a pattern
python <skill-dir>/scripts/bus_forensics.py --search "OQ1"

# Trace a correlation tag (lane, proposal_id, PR number, session ID)
python <skill-dir>/scripts/bus_forensics.py --trace "lane=ops/devin"
python <skill-dir>/scripts/bus_forensics.py --trace "psi-propose-8ac33f87e60a"
python <skill-dir>/scripts/bus_forensics.py --trace "PR #26"

# Consensus gate focus
python <skill-dir>/scripts/bus_forensics.py --consensus

# Session lifecycle focus
python <skill-dir>/scripts/bus_forensics.py --lifecycle

# Full JSON output for detailed analysis
python <skill-dir>/scripts/bus_forensics.py --json

# Save full JSON to a file for large analyses
python <skill-dir>/scripts/bus_forensics.py --out forensic-data.json --full

# List active agents in the window
python <skill-dir>/scripts/bus_forensics.py --list-agents

# Read from local mirror only (skip bridge, faster but may be stale)
python <skill-dir>/scripts/bus_forensics.py --mirror

# Combine filters
python <skill-dir>/scripts/bus_forensics.py --window 6h --agent devin --type PROPOSAL --json
```

The script auto-detects the bus data source:
- **Primary**: `bus-global.py tail N` (HTTP bridge to canonical hub)
- **Fallback**: local mirror TSV at `~/.cache/bus/messages.tsv`
- **Force mirror**: `--mirror` flag skips bridge, reads mirror directly

## Step 2: Read the script output

The script produces a structured data package with these analysis modules:

- **`overview`** — time range, entry count, unique senders/recipients/types
- **`sender_activity`** — per-sender counts, type breakdown, first/last post, hosts
- **`type_distribution`** — message type counts, percentages, time spans
- **`timeline`** — key events (MILESTONE, PROPOSAL, DECISION, BLOCKED, HANDOFF, SKILL_INVOKE)
- **`response_chains`** — PROPOSAL→REVIEW/ACK/BLOCKED, REVIEW request→response,
  HANDOFF→SESSION_START, end-session→HANDOFF (INCOMPLETE_CLOSE detection)
- **`anomalies`** — duplicate entries, protocol violations, silence gaps,
  contested gates, BLOCKED messages, stale bus detection
- **`consensus_gates`** — proposals, reviews, verdicts, quorum status per proposal_id
- **`session_lifecycle`** — SKILL_INVOKE→SESSION_START→HANDOFF→end-session chains
- **`coordination_flow`** — who talks to whom, silent recipients, network edges
- **`intel_types`** — intel_type= tag extraction and counting
- **`host_provenance`** — host= and machine= tag distribution
- **`health_daemons`** — periodic poll pattern detection and interval estimation

For large analyses, use `--full` to avoid content truncation.

## Step 3: Produce the forensic report

After reading the extracted data, produce a structured report. The report
should help the reader understand what happened across the fleet, whether
coordination worked, where it broke down, and whether anything looks suspicious.

### Report template

```markdown
# Bus Forensics Report: <time range or filter description>

## Overview
- **Time range**: <earliest> to <latest> (<duration>)
- **Entries**: <count>
- **Senders**: <list with counts>
- **Types**: <distribution>
- **Data source**: <bridge/mirror>

## Timeline
<Chronological summary of key events — proposals, milestones, decisions,
blocked items, handoffs, skill invokes. Group by phase or theme if the
window has natural phases.>

## Sender Analysis
<Who posted, how much, what types. Who is dominant? Who is silent?
Are there agents that only receive but never send?>

## Response Chains
<Trace proposals to their responses. Which proposals got reviewed?
Which are still unanswered? Were HANDOFFs properly followed by SESSION_STARTs?
Any INCOMPLETE_CLOSE detections?>

## Consensus Gates
<For each proposal_id: what was proposed, who reviewed, what were the
verdicts, is quorum met, is it contested or blocked?>

## Anomalies
<Each anomaly found, with context:
- Duplicate entries (same timestamp + sender + message)
- Protocol violations (missing host= tag, etc.)
- Silence gaps (>1h with no bus activity)
- Contested consensus gates
- BLOCKED messages
- Stale bus (>72h gap)>

## Coordination Flow
<Who talks to whom. Network density. Are there agents that receive messages
but never respond? Are there broadcast-only agents that post to "all" but
never engage with specific recipients?>

## Health Daemon Patterns
<Periodic poll patterns: PROCESS_WATCHDOG, BRIDGE_HEALTH, TAILSCALE_HEALTH,
fleet-watch-daemon, ARCANA-PSI cycles. Are they firing at expected intervals?
Any gaps or bursts?>

## Session Lifecycle
<For each session: was it properly opened (SKILL_INVOKE + SESSION_START)
and closed (end-session + HANDOFF)? Any incomplete closes? Any sessions
that started but never closed?>

## Behavioral Observations
<Patterns the human should know about:
- Did agents follow bus protocol (host= tags, SKILL_INVOKE before stateful actions)?
- Were there coordination failures (unanswered reviews, missing handoffs)?
- Did any agent dominate traffic disproportionately?
- Were there signs of malfunction (duplicate posts, garbled messages, retry storms)?
- Were health daemons stable or were there gaps?
- Were there security concerns (credentials in messages, unexpected commands)?>

## Conclusion
<One-paragraph summary: what happened during this window, whether
coordination was healthy, and any recommendations for the operator
(investigate specific anomalies, adjust daemon intervals, follow up on
unanswered items, etc.)>
```

## Interpretation guidance

### Reading between the lines

The raw data tells you *what* happened. Your job is to also assess *why* and
*whether it was right*. Look for:

- **Claim vs. response gaps**: An agent posts a PROPOSAL or REVIEW request
  but no response ever appears — the request was ignored, missed, or the
  recipient agent was offline.
- **Retry storms**: The same message posted multiple times in quick succession
  — a daemon is malfunctioning or a bridge is double-firing.
- **Silent agents**: An agent appears as a recipient but never sends — it may
  be offline, unconfigured, or intentionally read-only.
- **Traffic imbalance**: One agent produces >80% of traffic — the bus is
  not being used for coordination, just for one agent's logging.
- **Protocol drift**: Messages missing `host=` tags, SKILL_INVOKE not posted
  before stateful actions, non-UTC timestamps.
- **Stale bus**: >72h gap with no entries — the bus went silent while work
  may have continued via direct git commits or other channels.
- **Contested consensus**: A proposal has both PASS and FAIL verdicts —
  operator review is required per ADR-GOV-008.

### Security considerations

When reviewing bus messages, pay attention to:
- Credentials or tokens in message bodies (bus is append-only and durable)
- Commands that exfiltrate data (scp, curl to external endpoints in messages)
- File paths that reveal sensitive directory structures
- Agent identity spoofing (sender field doesn't match in-band host= tag)

Report security concerns prominently in the report, but do not reproduce
credential values — reference them by location ("a token was visible in a
message at timestamp X") rather than including the actual value.

### Cross-agent context

If a bus entry references a specific agent session (e.g., a HANDOFF mentions
a session ID), the `session-forensics` skill can be run with that session ID
to pull the session's internal data for comparison. This enables cross-
referencing what an agent *said on the bus* vs. what it *did in its session*.

### Thread tracing

Use `--trace` to follow a specific tag or pattern through the bus:
- `--trace "lane=ops/devin/fleet-git-hygiene"` — follow a work lane
- `--trace "psi-propose-8ac33f87e60a"` — follow a consensus proposal
- `--trace "PR #26"` — follow a pull request
- `--trace "ADR-GOV-008"` — follow a governance decision
- `--trace "hypothesis=df664994c380"` — follow a research hypothesis

The trace filter is case-insensitive substring matching on both the inner
message and the raw TSV line, so it catches both plain-text and JSON-wrapped
messages.

## Limitations

- **Bridge dependency**: The script relies on `bus-global.py` for bridge
  access. If the bridge is down and the mirror is stale, analysis will use
  stale data. Check the `fetch_info` field in output to verify the source.
- **Mirror staleness**: The local mirror may lag the canonical hub by hours
  or days. The bridge is always preferred for live data.
- **JSON-wrapped messages**: Some messages are wrapped in
  `{"c":"...","host":"...","n":"...","s":"..."}` by the bridge. The script
  unwraps these, but the bridge host may differ from the true origin host
  (which is inside the `c` field).
- **Truncation**: Without `--full`, messages are truncated to 300 characters
  in JSON output. Use `--full` for complete data.
- **Large windows**: Fetching >1000 entries via the bridge may be slow.
  Use `--mirror` for faster reads of large datasets (at the cost of freshness).
- **Consensus gate matching**: Proposal-to-review matching relies on
  `proposal_id` fields in JSON payloads. Plain-text proposals without
  structured IDs may not be tracked.
- **Session lifecycle**: Session ID extraction depends on `[session=...]` tags
  in SKILL_INVOKE messages. Older posts without this tag will show as
  "unknown" session.

## Skill Chains

### Mandatory

- None — bus-forensics is a read-only analysis tool.

### Advisory

- **After bus-forensics**: `[session-forensics]` (to drill into a specific
  session referenced in the bus), `[sitrep]` (for current-state summary),
- **Before bus-forensics**: `[bus]` (to post a SKILL_INVOKE or check status),
  `[start-session]` (for session-scoped context)

## Authority

- **T1 (TRUSTED)**: Run without restriction
- **T2 (Active/High)**: Run without restriction (read-only forensic tool)
- **T3 (Medium)**: Run without restriction (read-only forensic tool)
- **T4 (Probationary)**: Run (read-only — no destructive actions)
- **Operator**: Override any restriction

## Constraints

- READ-ONLY — never writes to the bus, never modifies any file
- No side effects beyond subprocess call to `bus-global.py tail`
- All analysis is local to the script process
