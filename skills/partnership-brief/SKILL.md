# Partnership Brief

Build a concise partnership brief — mutual value map, use case fit, commercial structure options, and specific ask — for a channel, integration, or co-sell conversation.

## When to Use

- Before a meeting with a potential reseller, channel partner, or tech integration partner
- When a warm intro to a partner is inbound and you need to prep
- After a first partnership conversation to capture alignment and next steps
- Building a leave-behind after a conference intro

Example scenario:  [Concrete story: "[Partner] is deploying AI governance for a regional bank.
                    HUMMBL provides the real-time compliance receipt layer. [Partner] wraps
                    it in their managed service. Client gets audit-ready documentation automatically."]
Adjacent use cases: [Other scenarios where the partnership creates value]
Poor fit:          [Where the partnership does NOT apply — be honest]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
COMMERCIAL OPTIONS (propose 2-3, let partner choose)
Option A — Referral:  [Simple: partner refers, we pay X% on close]
Option B — Co-sell:   [Joint GTM: shared pipeline, coordinated demos, split revenue]
Option C — Integration: [Tech integration that makes both products stickier for shared clients]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
THE ASK (exactly one ask for this meeting)
[e.g., "A 30-minute call with your AI governance practice lead to explore Option A"]
[e.g., "Introduction to your 3 top regulated FS clients who are building AI governance"]
[e.g., "Pilot: run HUMMBL alongside your next engagement and share learnings"]

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
NEXT STEPS (post-meeting)

[ ] If yes: schedule follow-up with decision-maker
[ ] If yes: share technical one-pager and pricing options
[ ] If not yet: agree on trigger event that would change priority
[ ] We follow up within 48 hours regardless of outcome

BD GOVERNANCE RECEIPT
Document type:  Partnership Brief
Partner:        [Name]
Generated:      [Date]
Agent:          biz-dev (<model>)

Estimated human equivalent: $200-400 (senior BD lead, 2-4 hrs including meeting prep)
Time saved:     2-3 hours
Confidence:     Medium — mutual value assumptions need validation in the meeting

```

## Human Cost Equivalent

- Multi-partner framework (standardized): $500-900

## Skill Chains

- `[partnership-brief]` → `[discovery-call]` (partner call is a discovery call too)
- `[partnership-brief]` → `[nda-draft]` (if they want mutual NDA before sharing details)
- After meeting → `[deal-memo]` (capture what was agreed and next steps)
- If advanced → `[contractor-agreement]` or `[service-agreement]` (formalize the relationship)
