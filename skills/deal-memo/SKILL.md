## When to Use

- After a first discovery call with a prospect
- After a warm intro that showed meaningful interest
- After a conference conversation worth following up
- After a partner meeting where commercial terms were explored
- Before handing a deal to a co-founder or advisor for their input

BD GOVERNANCE RECEIPT
Document type:  Deal Memo
Company:        [Name]
Generated:      [Date]
Agent:          biz-dev (<model>)
Review required: Recommended — especially before sharing deal shape with co-founders or advisors
Estimated human equivalent: $100-200 (senior AE, 1-2 hrs post-call documentation)
Time saved:     1-2 hours
Confidence:     High (if inputs are accurate) — this document is only as good as your recall
⚠ Write while fresh. Signal assessment degrades after 24 hours.
```

## Signal Interpretation Guide

| Signal | What it means | Action |
|--------|--------------|--------|
| They asked about pricing | Budget thinking has started | Send pricing guide + pilot framing |
| They asked for references | Active evaluation mode | Provide case study proxy + offer reference call |
| They said "we're building it" | Not a no — they want to validate the build | Ask what they've built so far |
| They went quiet after warm intro | Either busy or lost | Single follow-up, then pause 30 days |
| They forwarded to a colleague | Internal champion is forming | Engage the colleague directly |
| They asked technical questions | Economic buyer isn't in the room yet | Ask who owns technical evaluation |

## Human Cost Equivalent

- Quick deal memo (20-min meeting): $75-150
- Full post-discovery memo: $150-250
- Complex multi-stakeholder deal: $250-400

## Skill Chains

- `[deal-memo]` → `[proposal-write]` (if signal is hot → move to proposal)
- `[deal-memo]` → `[discovery-call]` (prep for next call using this memo)
- `[deal-memo]` → `[send-email]` (send the follow-up)
- `[deal-memo]` → `[crm]` (log the contact and deal stage)
- If partner meeting → `[partnership-brief]` (update brief with learnings)
- Monthly → `[win-loss]` (analyze deals that closed or went cold)
