# Testimonial

Collect, store, format, and organize client testimonials for use in marketing materials, proposals, and case studies. Maintains a testimonial library with metadata for easy retrieval.

## When to Use
- A client provides positive feedback you want to capture formally
- You need to pull testimonials for a proposal or pitch deck
- You want to format raw feedback into polished marketing quotes
- You need to organize testimonials by industry, service, or outcome

## Execution
1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for action (add/list/format) and optional client name
2. If `add`: collect testimonial text, client name, title, company, date, and tags (industry, service)
3. If `list`: display all stored testimonials with filters by client, tag, or recency
4. If `format`: transform raw feedback into polished testimonial formats:
   - Pull quote (1-2 sentences, bold key phrase)
   - Card format (quote + attribution + logo placeholder)
   - Case study excerpt (context + quote + result)
5. Store in a structured format for cross-session retrieval
6. Suggest placement opportunities (website, proposal, deck)
