# AI Risk Assessment

Produce a structured AI system risk assessment — risk identification, severity scoring, control gap analysis, and remediation priorities — aligned to NIST AI RMF or requested framework.

## When to Use

- Before deploying a new AI system into production
- After an AI incident or near-miss
- As part of a periodic governance review cycle
- When a board, auditor, or regulator asks "what are your AI risks?"
- During vendor due diligence (assess the system, not just the vendor)
- When a new LLM use case is being evaluated

## Required Inputs

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| System name | Customer service chatbot / Fraud detection model / LLM-assisted underwriting |
| Use case | Automated loan decisioning / Claims triage / Employee productivity assistant |
| Model type | LLM (GPT-4o) / Classification model / Generative AI / Recommendation system |
| Data used | Customer PII / Medical records / Financial transactions / Public data |
| Decision type | Automated / Human-in-the-loop / Human-on-the-loop / Informational only |
| Affected population | External customers / Employees / Patients / Students |
| Regulatory context | Financial services / Healthcare / Federal / General commercial |
| Current controls | [What governance is already in place — or "none"] |

## Skill Chains

- `[ai-risk-assessment]` → `[nist-map]` (detailed framework mapping)
- `[ai-risk-assessment]` → `[remediation-plan]` (build the fix roadmap)
- `[ai-risk-assessment]` → `[gap-analysis]` (compare to framework requirements)
- `[ai-risk-assessment]` → `[governance-report]` (board-ready summary)
- `[ai-risk-assessment]` → `[incident-response-plan]` (if high/critical rating)
- For vendor systems → `[vendor-ai-review]` (assess vendor's governance claims first)
