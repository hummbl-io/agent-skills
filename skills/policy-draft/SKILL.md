# Policy Draft

Draft structured internal policies covering AI acceptable use, data handling, incident response, access control, and other governance areas. Produces professional policy documents with standard sections, review workflows, and version tracking.

## When to Use
- Creating a new internal policy from scratch
- Updating an existing policy to meet new regulatory requirements
- Drafting a client-facing policy document for an engagement
- Filling a gap identified by a governance audit or compliance check

## Execution
1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for policy type, `--audience` (default: internal), and `--template` (default: standard).
2. Select the appropriate policy template based on type: AI acceptable use, data handling, incident response, access control, change management, vendor management.
3. **Supadata research** — scrape reference policies and templates for best-practice language:
   ```bash
   export SUPADATA_API_KEY="$(cat ~/supadata\ api.txt | grep sd_)"
   # Scrape NIST's template/resource pages for policy structure
   python3 ~/bin/supadata.py scrape "https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-ri[REDACTED_API_KEY]"
   # Scrape regulatory requirements that policies must address
   python3 ~/bin/supadata.py scrape "https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32024R1689"
   # Scrape industry-standard policy templates (e.g., SANS, CIS)
   python3 ~/bin/supadata.py scrape "https://www.sans.org/information-security-policy"
   # Crawl a competitor's trust center for benchmarking
   python3 ~/bin/supadata.py crawl "https://vendor.com/trust" --max-pages 10
   ```
4. For `standard` template: include purpose, scope, definitions, roles and responsibilities, policy statements, procedures, exceptions, enforcement, review schedule.
4. For `minimal` template: include purpose, scope, key policy statements, and review schedule.
5. Pre-fill with organization-specific context from existing docs (CLAUDE.md, governance artifacts).
6. For `client` audience: adjust tone, add confidentiality notice, include regulatory references.
7. Mark sections requiring human review with [REVIEW NEEDED] tags.
8. Include version tracking header and approval workflow.
