# Healthcare AI Watch

Track the four regulatory surfaces governing AI in US/EU healthcare. Each is on a different update cadence; missing a delta affects HUMMBL governance positioning for medical / pharma / device clients. Feeds 3 of 5 coverage-matrix gaps (ONC HTI-1, FDA PCCP, HIPAA).

## When to Use

- Monthly cadence during any active healthcare-AI engagement
- Before HUMMBL coverage matrix update cycles
- Before any healthcare-vertical proposal, SOW, or assessment report
- On-trigger: FDA guidance publication, ONC final rule, HHS HIPAA NPRM, EU AI Act medical-device delegated act

## Focus Areas

| Focus | Covers | Why It Matters |
|---|---|---|
| `onc` | ONC HTI-1 (Decision Support Interventions / Predictive DSI transparency) + HTI-2 (forthcoming) | Most stringent US healthcare-AI transparency rule; in force; binding on certified EHRs |
| `fda` | FDA PCCP (Predetermined Change Control Plan) for SaMD/AI; AI/ML SaMD Action Plan | Governs continuous-learning AI in medical devices; FDA has cleared >900 AI devices as of 2025 |
| `hipaa` | HHS HIPAA modernization NPRMs, AI-specific guidance on PHI in training data | Affects HUMMBL data-handling posture for any client with PHI in scope |
| `eu` | EU AI Act medical-device classification (Annex III + MDR/IVDR intersection) | High-risk class for medical AI; conformity-assessment requirements differ from MDR alone |

## Coverage Matrix Gap Closure

Maps to coverage gaps at `PROJECTS/.agents/docs/coverage/`:
- **ONC HTI-1** — `docs/coverage/onc-hti1.md` (NEW; this skill is the upstream source)
- **FDA PCCP** — `docs/coverage/fda-pccp.md` (NEW)
- **HIPAA AI** — `docs/coverage/hipaa-ai.md` (NEW; carved out of generic HIPAA)

When a delta lands, file an issue against `hummbl-io/agents` titled `coverage: healthcare-ai <surface> delta YYYY-MM-DD`.

## Live Data Fetch

Before manual source scanning, pull live data from free APIs to surface recent publications and regulatory actions:

```bash
# PubMed — recent AI healthcare regulation literature
python ~/bin/free_apis.py pubmed search "AI healthcare regulation OR AI medical device OR AI clinical decision support" --limit 25

# PubMed — fetch full abstract for a specific PMID
python ~/bin/free_apis.py pubmed fetch --pmid <PMID>

# Federal Register — recent AI-related healthcare agency notices
python ~/bin/free_apis.py fedreg search "artificial intelligence" --agencies "food-and-drug-administration" "health-and-human-services-department" --limit 25 --since 2026-01-01

# OpenAlex — scholarly literature on AI governance in healthcare
python ~/bin/free_apis.py openalex search "AI governance healthcare medical device" --limit 25
```

These calls are keyless (no API key required) and return structured data. Use the results to identify deltas since the last watch cycle before manually scraping P1 source pages.

- Monthly: P1 sources scan (full depth, ~20 min — healthcare regs change slowly but breaking)
- Quarterly: P2/P3 sources sweep (~30 min)
- On-trigger: FDA press release on AI clearance / enforcement; ONC final-rule publication; HHS HIPAA NPRM open; EU AI Act Annex III delegated act published
