# [study-plan]

## When to Use
- Preparing for a certification exam (CCA-F, AWS, Anthropic Certified Architect)
- Structuring self-study on a new technical topic
- Building a day-by-day schedule with spaced repetition
- Reviewing or adjusting an existing study plan

## Execution

### Inputs
- **topic** (required): Certification or subject (e.g., "CCA-F", "AWS SAA", "Rust")
- **exam-date** (optional): Target date, default 4 weeks from today
- **hours-per-day** (optional): Available study hours, default 2

### Steps
1. Calculate total available study days and hours
2. Break topic into domains/modules (use official exam guide if certification)
3. Weight domains by exam percentage or complexity
4. Assign domains to days with progressive difficulty
5. Insert spaced repetition reviews:
   - Day+1: quick review of previous day (15 min)
   - Day+3: review of 3 days ago (15 min)
   - Day+7: weekly comprehensive review (30 min)
   - Day+14: bi-weekly full review (45 min)
6. Schedule practice exams in final 20% of timeline
7. Save plan to `_state/study/<topic>/plan.md`

### Known Certifications
- **CCA-F**: 5 domains, materials at `$PROJECTS_DIR/your-study-repo/`
- **AWS SAA**: Use official exam guide domain weights
- **Anthropic Certified Architect**: Use published certification requirements
