# Feature Store Management Command

Manage machine learning feature stores to ensure consistency between training and serving, track feature lineage, and maintain data quality for ML pipelines.

## When to Use
- Setting up new ML projects requiring feature management
- When user mentions feature consistency or data pipeline concerns
- Tracking feature versions and dependencies
- Ensuring training-serving parity in ML systems
- Managing feature updates and backfilling

## Execution

### 1. Parse Feature Specification
Accept either:
- Specific feature name or version to manage
- Feature pipeline specification or definition
- Feature store configuration or connection details
- Query for existing features or statistics

### 2. Connect to Feature Store
Establish connection to the feature store backend:
- Validate connection parameters and credentials
- Check feature store health and availability
- Verify schema compatibility and access permissions

### 3. Execute Feature Operations
Based on the argument, perform appropriate actions:
- **Feature Retrieval**: Get feature values for training or serving
- **Feature Registration**: Define new features with metadata
- **Materialization**: Compute and store feature values
- **Validation**: Check feature quality, completeness, and drift
- **Lineage Tracking**: Trace feature origins and transformations
- **Versioning**: Manage feature updates and backward compatibility

### 4. Ensure Training-Serving Parity
Verify that features used for training match those used for serving:
- Compare feature definitions between environments
- Validate transformation logic consistency
- Check for temporal leakage or data leakage risks
- Confirm point-in-time correctness for historical features

### 5. Generate Feature Report
Provide insights into feature usage, quality, and management status.
