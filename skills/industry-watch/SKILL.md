# Industry Watch

Track AI announcements across the major players and open-source ecosystem. Complements `[anthropic-watch]` (which covers Anthropic exclusively) and `[competitive-intel]` (which does positioning analysis). This skill is pure signal collection -- what shipped, what changed, what's coming.

## HUMMBL Market Intel Frame

Default reporting structure for material findings:

1. `position`
   The vendor's explicit stance, doctrine, policy claim, or strategic framing.
2. `action`
   The concrete launch, restriction, rollout, partnership, product move, or enforcement step.
3. `reaction`
   The measurable market, customer, policy, competitor, or public response.
4. `routing_implication`
   What HUMMBL should do with the signal: monitor, adopt, avoid, escalate, or convert into another artifact.

Use this frame by default for:

- policy-sensitive announcements
- safety or cybersecurity launches
- market-moving model releases
- major partner ecosystem changes
- regulatory or public-trust signals

Do not stop at "what happened." Convert the finding into operator-usable routing.

## When to Use
- Morning routine (pair with `[anthropic-watch]` and `[daily-research]`)
- Before architecture decisions involving non-Anthropic services
- Before investor updates or competitive positioning
- When user asks "what's new in AI" or "what did X announce"
- Weekly cadence minimum; daily during conference seasons (GTC, I/O, WWDC, Build, re:Invent, dev week)

## Default Output Shape

For each material item, prefer this compact schema:

```yaml
vendor:
date:
position:
action:
reaction:
routing_implication:
confidence:
sources:
```

If reaction is not yet measurable, say so explicitly instead of inferring market impact.

## Execution

### Supadata CLI Setup

Before running, ensure the Supadata key is available:

```bash
export SUPADATA_API_KEY="$(cat ~/supadata\ api.txt | grep sd_)"
```

The `supadata.py` CLI at `~/bin/supadata.py` wraps all endpoints. Commands used in this skill:
- `scrape <url>` — fetch page as clean Markdown (1 credit)
- `map <url>` — discover all URLs on a site (1 credit)
- `transcript <url> --text` — extract video transcript (1 credit)
- `metadata <url>` — get video metadata without full transcript (1 credit)

### quick (default -- 5 minutes)

Headline scan. Hit P1 sources only for specified vendors (or all). Use Supadata to fetch actual content from the top 2-3 vendor blogs.

1. **For each vendor** (or all if `--vendor all`):
   ```
   WebSearch "<vendor> AI announcement 2026" (last 7 days)
   WebSearch "<vendor> model release 2026" (last 7 days)
   ```
   Then for the 1-2 most promising P1 URLs found:
   ```
   python3 ~/bin/supadata.py scrape "<vendor-blog-url>"
   ```

2. **Open source sweep**:
   ```
   WebSearch "open source AI model release 2026" (last 7 days)
   WebSearch "huggingface trending model" (last 7 days)
   ```

3. **Output**: Findings table (see Output Format)

### full (15-20 minutes)

Deep sweep across all priorities for all vendors. Use Supadata to scrape every P1 blog/changelog directly, and crawl docs sites for API/schema changes.

1. **All quick steps**

2. **Per-vendor deep dive** — scrape P1 sources directly:

4. **Cross-cutting signals**:
   ```
   WebSearch "AI model benchmark leaderboard 2026"
   WebSearch "AI inference cost comparison 2026"
   WebSearch "AI regulation update 2026" (last 14 days)
   WebSearch "AI agent framework new 2026"
   ```

5. **Conference check** (if in season):
   ```
   WebSearch "GTC 2026" OR "Google I/O 2026" OR "WWDC 2026" OR "Microsoft Build 2026"
   ```
   If keynotes are on YouTube, extract transcripts:
   ```bash
   python3 ~/bin/supadata.py transcript "<keynote-youtube-url>" --text
   ```

6. **Site crawling** — for documentation sites to detect new APIs/endpoints:
   ```bash
   python3 ~/bin/supadata.py map "https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock" 2>/dev/null | head -20
   python3 ~/bin/supadata.py map "https://platform.openai.com/docs" 2>/dev/null | head -20
   ```

## What to Persist

After a **full** run with significant findings:
- Update memory if a model release or deprecation affects our stack
- Post to bus if findings are actionable for other agents
- Suggest `[decision-log]` if findings change architecture direction
- Suggest `[send-email] dan` if findings affect business strategy
- Update `[anthropic-watch]` comparison if a competitor matches/exceeds Anthropic capability

## Skill Chains

| After this skill... | Consider... |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Major model release | `[competitive-intel]` for positioning, `[anthropic-watch]` for Anthropic response |
| Pricing change | `[runway]` to recalculate costs |
| New open-source model | Evaluate for $REMOTE_HOST deployment (check params vs 48GB M4 Pro) |
| Infrastructure update | `[arch-diagram]` if it changes our stack |
| Policy/regulation news | `[daily-research] --ingest` to add to governance knowledge base |
| Conference week | `[loop] 1d [industry-watch] --vendor <vendor> --depth full` |
| Multiple vendor moves | `[investor-update]` or `[changelog-digest]` for the team lead |
| benchmark newly announced models via free-tier routing | `[reasoning-router]` (`route`) |
