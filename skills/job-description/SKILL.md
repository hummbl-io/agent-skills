- Evaluating whether a role should be employee vs contractor
- Creating an interview scorecard (JD is the foundation)

## JD Structure

```
[COMPANY]: [1-line company pitch — what you do, why it matters]

ABOUT THE ROLE
[2-3 sentences: what this person owns, why it matters now]

WHAT YOU'LL DO
- [Key responsibility 1]

- [Key responsibility 3]
- [Key responsibility 4-5 as needed]

WHAT YOU BRING (Required)
- [Must-have requirement 1]
- [Must-have requirement 2]

COMPENSATION & BENEFITS
[Range] + [equity if applicable] + [key benefits]

LOCATION: [detail]
TYPE: [Full-time / Contract]

[Company] is an equal opportunity employer. We do not discriminate on the basis of race,
color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or any other characteristic
protected by applicable law.
```

## EEO / Bias Flags

The agent will flag language that could create legal exposure or reduce candidate diversity:
- Age-coded terms: "digital native", "recent graduate", "young and hungry"
- Gender-coded terms: "rockstar", "ninja", "aggressive"
- Requirement inflation: requiring 10+ years for tools that are <5 years old
- Unnecessary degree requirements when skills matter more

## Human Cost Equivalent

- Basic job posting: $100-200 HR consultant or recruiter time
- Detailed JD with levels/bands: $200-400

## Skill Chains

- JD → `[offer-letter]` (when ready to make the hire)
- JD posted → `[crm]` (track applicants)
