# Discovery Call Prep

Prepares for a discovery call by researching the prospect company, generating tailored questions based on their industry and pain points, providing a structured note-taking template, and drafting a follow-up email. Focus areas can be narrowed to governance, security, or AI topics.

## When to Use
- Before a first meeting with a potential client or partner
- When preparing for a sales or partnership discovery conversation
- When you need structured questions tailored to a specific company's context
- Before any call where you want to arrive informed and organized

## Execution
1. Research the company: website, LinkedIn, recent news, funding, tech stack, industry
2. Identify the contact's role and likely priorities based on title and department
3. Generate 8-12 tailored discovery questions organized by category (pain points, current state, goals, budget/timeline)
4. Build a note-taking template with sections: attendees, key quotes, pain points identified, next steps, objections
5. Draft a follow-up email template with placeholders for call-specific details
6. Flag any competitive intel or existing relationships in CRM if available
