# Executive Summary

Distill any long document into a concise, actionable 1-page summary.

## When to Use
- Briefing stakeholders or stakeholders on a technical topic
- Summarizing research findings for non-technical audience
- Creating cover pages for assessment reports
- Preparing for investor or partner meetings

## Execution

1. **Read source** document or analysis
2. **Identify** key findings, decisions, risks, and next steps
3. **Adapt tone** for audience (technical detail vs business impact)
4. **Structure**:
   - Situation (1-2 sentences)
   - Key Findings (3-5 bullets)
   - Recommendations (2-3 prioritized)
   - Next Steps (with owners and dates)
   - Risk/Opportunity callout (if applicable)
5. **Constrain** to ~300 words / 1 printed page
