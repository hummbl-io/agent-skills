# Vendor AI Review

Conduct governance due diligence on a third-party AI tool or vendor. Grades transparency, security controls, contractual protections, and regulatory alignment before procurement.

## When to Use

- Before procuring any AI tool that processes customer data, makes decisions, or assists regulated processes
- When an existing AI vendor relationship needs governance review
- When a board or compliance committee asks "what AI tools are we using and are they safe?"
- During M&A due diligence when the target uses AI in core operations
- When a regulator asks about third-party model risk

## Required Inputs

| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Vendor name | OpenAI / Salesforce / Workday / Cohere / Vendor X |
| Product | ChatGPT Enterprise / Einstein GPT / AI recruitment tool |
| Use case | Customer support / Financial analysis / Hiring decisions |
| Data shared | Customer PII / Employee data / Financial records / None |
| Decision impact | Low (informational) / Medium (influenced decision) / High (automated decision) |
| Regulatory context | FINRA / HIPAA / FCRA / GDPR / EU AI Act / None specified |
| Vendor documentation | [Provide AI transparency card, terms, DPA, security report if available] |

## Supadata Vendor Research

Before filling the scorecard, scrape vendor documentation directly:

```bash
export SUPADATA_API_KEY="$(cat ~/supadata\ api.txt | grep sd_)"

# Fetch vendor's AI policy / transparency page
python3 ~/bin/supadata.py scrape "https://vendor.com/ai-policy"

# Fetch terms of service and privacy policy
python3 ~/bin/supadata.py scrape "https://vendor.com/terms"
python3 ~/bin/supadata.py scrape "https://vendor.com/privacy"

# Discover documentation pages (security, DPA, SOC 2 reports)
python3 ~/bin/supadata.py map "https://vendor.com/trust"
python3 ~/bin/supadata.py map "https://vendor.com/security"

# For vendors with changelogs — find recent AI-related changes
python3 ~/bin/supadata.py scrape "https://vendor.com/changelog"

# Crawl vendor docs for AI-specific claims (cap depth to avoid credit burn)
python3 ~/bin/supadata.py crawl "https://docs.vendor.com" --max-pages 15
```

**Why**: Vendor AI reviews are only as good as the documentation you can verify. Supadata lets you scrape terms, privacy policies, security pages, and changelogs directly — then extract specific AI governance claims for the scorecard. Without it, you're grading on what the vendor chooses to tell you.

Document type:  Vendor AI Review
Vendor:         [Name / Product]
Generated:      [Date]
Agent:          compliance-advisor (claude-opus-4-6)
Frameworks:     NIST AI RMF, OWASP LLM Top 10, EU AI Act, SOC 2, ISO 27001
Attestation:    DRAFT — requires qualified procurement/legal review before finalizing
Estimated human equivalent: $600-1,500 (AI risk officer + procurement counsel, 3-6 hrs)
Time saved:     3-6 hours
Confidence:     Medium — gaps exist where vendor documentation was unavailable
⚠ Not legal advice. Contract terms must be reviewed by qualified legal counsel.
```

## Human Cost Equivalent

- Lightweight scorecard (standard SaaS tool): $300-600
- Full vendor AI review (high-risk system): $600-1,500
- Enterprise AI vendor management program (all vendors): $5,000-15,000

## Skill Chains

- `[vendor-ai-review]` → `[nda-draft]` (if vendor requires NDA before sharing documentation)
- `[vendor-ai-review]` → `[contractor-agreement]` or `[service-agreement]` (add AI governance clauses)
- `[vendor-ai-review]` → `[ai-risk-assessment]` (assess the deployed system after procurement)
- `[vendor-ai-review]` → `[governance-report]` (include vendor risk in board update)
- Annually → re-run `[vendor-ai-review]` on high-risk vendors
