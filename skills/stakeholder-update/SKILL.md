## When to Use

- Monthly investor update
- Board meeting narrative (quarterly)
- Key partner check-in (not a sales call)
- Enterprise client progress update (between formal reports)

- Keeping a mentor or advisor in the loop

## Skill Chains

### Mandatory

- `[content-review]` MUST pass before sending the update externally to any stakeholder (investor, board, partner, customer, team). The draft may be generated without it, but no external delivery without a passed content review.

### Advisory

- `[stakeholder-update]` → `[send-email]` — deliver the update (requires `[content-review]` pass first)
- `[stakeholder-update]` (board version) → `[exec-summary]` — condensed 1-pager
- `[stakeholder-update]` → `[investor-update]` — formal version with full financial table
- Before writing → `[financial-model]` or `[runway]` — pull current metrics

## Authority

- **T1 (TRUSTED)**: Full run — draft and send (with `[content-review]` pass)
- **T2 (Active/High)**: Draft and send with `[content-review]` pass
- **T3 (Medium)**: Draft only; sending requires operator approval + `[content-review]` pass
- **T4 (Probationary)**: BLOCKED — may not draft or send stakeholder updates
- **Operator**: Override any restriction
