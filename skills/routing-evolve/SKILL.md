# Routing Evolution Engine

Cross-reference skill-routing.md trigger patterns against telemetry data. Find dead triggers, missing triggers, cannibalized skills, and orphan skills that are completely invisible.

## When to Use
- After creating new skills (verify they're routable)
- Weekly skill library health check (pair with `[skill-evolve]`)
- When skills seem hard to discover
- Before pruning or expanding routing patterns

## Data Sources

### 1. Routing File
`~/.agents/skill-routing.md` — trigger patterns.

### 2. Telemetry
`~/.agents/_state/telemetry/skill-usage.tsv` — actual invocations.

### 3. Skill Directories
`~/.agents/skills/*/SKILL.md` — all installed skills.

## Execution

### Run the analysis

cd $HOME && python -c "

```

## Constraints

- READ-ONLY. Do not modify routing or telemetry files.
- Do not fabricate counts. Parse actual data.
- With <30 sessions, dead triggers are LOW confidence — the skill may simply not have been needed yet.
- Orphan skills are not necessarily broken — they may be inventory for future use.
