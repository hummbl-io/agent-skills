# [mono-diff]

## When to Use
- Weekly review: what changed across all repos?
- After a multi-repo work session: summarize all changes
- Preparing a changelog or status update for stakeholders
- Understanding cross-repo impact of a coordinated change

## Execution

### Inputs
- **since-date** (optional): Default 7 days ago. Accepts: `YYYY-MM-DD`, `yesterday`, `last-week`, `last-month`
- **--repo**: Only include specific repo(s), comma-separated
- **--author**: Filter by git author name or email

### Steps
1. Enumerate all git repos under `~/PROJECTS/` and root `~/`
2. For each repo:
   a. `git log --oneline --since=<date>` -- list commits
   b. `git diff --stat HEAD~N..HEAD` or since-based diff -- get committed change stats
   c. `git status --short --untracked-files=all` -- flag current uncommitted/untracked work separately
   d. Count: commits, committed files changed, insertions, deletions, plus dirty/untracked counts
3. Skip repos with zero commits in the period only if their worktree is also clean; otherwise include a "dirty but no commits" section
4. Sort by activity (most commits first)
5. Group commits by conventional commit type (feat, fix, refactor, test, etc.)
6. Aggregate cross-repo totals

## Output Format

------------------------------------------------------------
Next: [changelog] (for release notes) or [repo-sync] (current state)
```

## Skill Chains
- After `[mono-diff]` -> suggest `[changelog]` for release notes
- After `[mono-diff]` -> suggest `[pr-summary]` for open PRs
- Use after `[repo-sync]` for full picture (state + history)
