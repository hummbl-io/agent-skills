# Anthropic Watch

Stay current on Anthropic announcements, releases, and ecosystem changes. Designed to catch things within hours/days of publication, not weeks.

## HUMMBL Market Intel Frame

Default reporting structure for material findings:

1. `position`
   Anthropic's explicit stance, doctrine, policy claim, or strategic framing.
2. `action`
   The concrete launch, restriction, rollout, partnership, publication, or enforcement move.
3. `reaction`
   The measurable market, customer, policy, competitor, or public response.
4. `routing_implication`
   What HUMMBL should do with the signal: monitor, adopt, avoid, escalate, or convert into another artifact.

Use this frame by default for:

- safety and policy announcements
- cybersecurity launches
- Claude model releases
- Claude Code changes with ecosystem impact
- partner program or enterprise trust signals

Do not stop at "what happened." Convert the finding into operator-usable routing.

## When to Use
- Morning routine (pair with `[daily-research]`)
- Before pitching Anthropic partnership or updating partner app
- Before making architecture decisions involving Claude models or API
- When user asks "what's new from Anthropic?"
- Weekly cadence minimum during active partner engagement

## Default Output Shape

For each material item, prefer this compact schema:

```yaml
vendor:
date:
position:
action:
reaction:
routing_implication:
confidence:
sources:
```

If reaction is not yet measurable, say so explicitly instead of inferring market impact.

For policy-sensitive or market-moving items, append a structured block using the HUMMBL frame:

```yaml
vendor: anthropic
date:
position:
action:
reaction:
routing_implication:
confidence:
sources:
```

## Cadence Recommendations

| Situation | Frequency | Depth |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| Normal operations | Weekly | quick |
| Active partner engagement | Every 2 days | full |
| Model launch window | Daily | full |
| Pre-pitch or pre-meeting | Day-of | full with focus |
| Post-major-announcement | Immediate | full |

## What to Persist

After a **full** run with significant findings:
- Update memory if a model deprecation or API change affects our code
- Post to bus if a finding is actionable for other agents
- Suggest `[decision-log]` if a finding changes our architecture
- Flag to user if partner program status changes

## Skill Chains

| After this skill... | Consider... |
|--------------------|-------------|
| New model announced | `[competitive-intel]`, update `AGENTS.md`, `.agents/ROSTER.md`, or model-tier references as applicable |
| API breaking change | `[bulk-edit]` to update affected code |
| Claude Code update | `[skill-test]` to verify skill compatibility |
| Safety paper published | `[daily-research] --ingest` to add to knowledge base |
| Partner program news | `[send-email]` to brief the team lead |
