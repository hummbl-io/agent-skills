# Changelog Command

Generate a Keep-a-Changelog formatted changelog between two git refs.

## Usage

```bash
[changelog] v0.2.0              # From v0.2.0 to HEAD
[changelog] v0.2.0 v0.3.0      # Between two tags
[changelog] abc1234             # From a specific commit to HEAD
```

## Execution

### 1. Get commits
```bash
git log --oneline --no-merges <from>..<to>
```
Default `<to>` is HEAD if not provided.

### 2. Categorize by conventional commit prefix

| Prefix | Category |
|--------|----------|
| `feat:` | Added |
| `fix:` | Fixed |
| `refactor:` | Changed |
| `perf:` | Changed |
| `docs:` | Documentation |
| `test:` | Testing |
| `chore:` | Maintenance |
| `security:` / `vuln:` | Security |
| `BREAKING CHANGE` | Breaking |
| *(other)* | Other |

### 3. Extract PR links
```bash
git log --oneline <from>..<to> | grep -o "#[0-9]*"
```

## Output Format

```
# Changelog: <from> → <to>
Generated: <YYYY-MM-DD>
Commits: N
