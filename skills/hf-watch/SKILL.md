# Hugging Face Watch

Stay current on the Hugging Face ecosystem. Catches model releases, leaderboard shifts, dataset drops, and platform changes within hours/days. Complements `[industry-watch]` (broad) and `[anthropic-watch]` (Anthropic-specific).

## When to Use
- Morning routine (pair with `[industry-watch]` and `[daily-research]`)
- Before choosing a model for local inference (remote-node dormant since 2026-07-01 — use Workstation, Desktop)
- Before starting autoresearch experiments (check if a new baseline exists)
- When user asks "what's trending on HuggingFace?" or "any new models?"
- After major model family releases (Llama, Qwen, Mistral, Gemma)
- Weekly cadence minimum; daily during model release waves
