# Churn Analysis

Detect early warning signs of client churn by analyzing engagement frequency, support interaction patterns, and renewal timeline proximity. Produces a risk score per client with actionable recommendations to improve retention.

## When to Use
- Quarterly review of client health across the portfolio
- Before a renewal conversation to understand risk level
- When engagement frequency with a client drops noticeably
- After a support escalation to assess broader relationship health

## Execution
1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for client filter (default: `all`), lookback period (default: `90d`), and signal types.
2. Gather engagement data from available sources:
   - CRM interactions (`_state/crm/` or Google Sheets via `[crm]`)
   - Email/meeting frequency (calendar, sent emails)
   - Bus messages and deliverable history
   - Invoice and payment patterns (`_state/billing/`)
3. For each client, compute signal scores:
   - **Engagement**: Compare current-period interaction frequency to baseline. Flag drops > 30%.
   - **Support**: Count support requests, escalations, and unresolved issues. Flag volume spikes > 2x.
   - **Renewal**: Days until contract end, renewal discussion status, competitor mentions.
4. Calculate composite churn risk score (0-100, where 100 = highest risk).
5. Classify each client: GREEN (0-30), YELLOW (31-60), RED (61-100).
6. Generate specific retention recommendations per at-risk client.
