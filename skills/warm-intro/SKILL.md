# Warm Intro

Draft a warm introduction email connecting two people with shared context, a clear reason for the introduction, and a specific ask. Pulls available context from CRM data to personalize the introduction.

## When to Use
- When connecting a prospect with a team member or partner
- When introducing two contacts who could mutually benefit from knowing each other
- When a client asks for a referral or connection in your network
- When facilitating partnership or collaboration introductions

## Execution
1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for both person names and optional context
2. Look up both contacts in CRM data if available
3. Identify mutual interests, complementary skills, or shared connections
4. Draft a double opt-in introduction email (ask both parties before connecting)
5. Include: who each person is, why they should meet, what the specific ask is
6. Keep the email concise (under 150 words for the intro body)

## Output Format
```
Warm Intro | <person_a> <> <person_b>
