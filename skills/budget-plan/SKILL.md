# Budget Plan

Create, review, and track budget allocations with variance analysis against actuals. Supports monthly and quarterly periods with category breakdowns and trend tracking.

## When to Use
- You need to create a budget for the upcoming month or quarter
- You want to review actual spend against budgeted amounts
- You need variance analysis to identify over/under-spending
- You are preparing financial reports for stakeholders

## Execution
1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for period (monthly/quarterly) and action (plan/review/variance)
2. If `plan`: create budget template with categories (personnel, infrastructure, tools, marketing, misc)
3. If `review`: compare budgeted vs actual spend per category
4. If `variance`: compute variance (actual - budget), variance %, and flag significant deviations (>10%)
5. Pull historical data from expense logs if available
6. Compute totals, category percentages, and month-over-month trends
7. Flag budget items that need attention (>10% over, or consistently under-utilized)
