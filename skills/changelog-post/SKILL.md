# Changelog Post

Transform raw git changelog entries into polished, audience-friendly content. Generates a "What's New" blog post, social media announcement, or email update from conventional commits.

## When to Use
- You just tagged a release and want to announce it publicly
- You need to turn technical commits into user-facing release notes
- You want a social-ready summary of recent changes
- You need an email update for stakeholders about what shipped

## Execution
1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for `--since` tag/ref and output format (blog/social/email)
2. Run `git log --oneline` since the specified tag to collect commits
3. Group commits by type (feat, fix, refactor, docs, chore, test)
4. Filter out internal-only changes (chore, refactor) for external audiences
5. Rewrite commit messages into user-friendly language
6. Generate output in the requested format:
   - Blog: full post with intro, sections, code highlights
   - Social: thread-ready posts (see `[thread-write]` format)
   - Email: newsletter-style with highlights and links
7. Add version number, date, and contributor credits

## Output Format
```
Changelog Post | <version> (<format>)

## Header
Version: <version>
Date: <date>
Commits: <N> (since <tag>)

## Content
<formatted content based on --format>

## Contributors

## Raw Changelog (reference)

Next action: <recommendation>
```
