# Cross-Runtime Epistemic Validation

## What This Skill Does

Runs a task (typically claim verification) against multiple independent AI
runtimes from **different model families** with epistemic blinding, then
measures whether cross-runtime convergence predicts correctness. Produces:

1. **Capability matrix** — per-runtime extraction recall, verdict accuracy, false support rate, privacy gate compliance
2. **Error correlation matrix** — Cohen's kappa on error patterns between each runtime pair (measures epistemic independence)
3. **Convergence analysis** — accuracy as a function of N runtimes agreeing
4. **Systematic bias profiles** — per-runtime tendency to flip specific verdicts (e.g., UNVERIFIABLE → SUPPORTED)

## When to Use

- You have a scored eval corpus (ground truth with expected verdicts)
- You want to validate that an agent's output is correct, not just plausible
- You suspect a single agent's output may be confabulated or prior-contaminated
- You want to measure whether multiple independent agents converging increases confidence
- You want to profile systematic biases of different model families

## The 5-Phase Protocol

### Phase 1: Design (Human)

**Goal**: Set up the experiment to produce valid convergence evidence.

1. **Define the task** — what question are you asking? (e.g., "verify these claims", "review this code", "answer this question")
2. **Build the corpus** — create test cases with:
   - Input text (what the agent sees)
   - Ground truth (what the agent does NOT see) — expected claims, expected verdicts, evidence hints
   - Config — risk threshold, mode (web-only, extract-only)
3. **Select runtimes** — choose 2+ runtimes from **different model families**:
   - Different model families = different training data, different architecture, different priors
   - Same model family (e.g., 3 GPT-4 instances) = weak epistemic independence
   - Cross-runtime (e.g., GLM + Llama + DeepSeek + MiniMax) = strong epistemic independence
4. **Design blinding** — what does each agent see?
   - Strip: ground truth, expected claim counts, skill name, prior work
   - Inline: task instructions (prevents search-time contamination)
   - Force: extract-only mode for non-web-search runtimes (fair comparison)
5. **Define convergence criterion** — what counts as agreement?
   - Exact verdict match (SUPPORTED == SUPPORTED)
   - Fuzzy match for extraction (claim text substring match)

### Phase 2: Independent Reconstruction (Each agent, blinded)

**Goal**: Each runtime produces its output independently, without seeing other
agents' work or the ground truth.

1. Build blinded prompts (inline instructions, strip ground truth)
2. Run each runtime against all corpus cases
3. Collect results as JSON (case_id, claims with verdicts)
4. Temperature = 0 for reproducibility
5. No cross-agent communication (agents don't see each other's outputs)

**Key principle**: The agent must not know it's being evaluated. Inlining
instructions prevents the agent from searching for the eval corpus online
(search-time contamination).

### Phase 3: Cross-Agent Review (Agent-to-agent, blinded)

**Goal**: One agent reviews another's output without knowing who produced it.

1. Take Runtime A's output and present it to Runtime B for review
2. B does not know which runtime produced the output
3. B does not know whether the output is "expected" or "correct"
4. B checks for flaws (missing claims, wrong verdicts, privacy gate violations)
5. B must be from a **different model family** than A

**This phase is optional** but valuable for catching subtle errors that
scoring alone misses. It tests whether an agent can detect errors in another
agent's work without anchoring to the expected answer.

### Phase 4: Scoring (Human + automated)

**Goal**: Score each runtime's output against ground truth and measure
cross-runtime convergence.

1. **Per-runtime scoring**:
   - Extraction recall: what fraction of ground-truth claims did the runtime find?
   - Verdict accuracy: for matched claims, does the verdict match expected?
   - False support rate: how often does the runtime assign SUPPORTED to a claim that should be CONTRADICTED or UNVERIFIABLE?
   - Privacy gate compliance: does the runtime correctly mark restricted claims?

2. **Error correlation (Cohen's kappa)**:
   - For each pair of runtimes, compute kappa on error patterns (1=wrong, 0=right)
   - High kappa = correlated errors = weak epistemic independence
   - Low kappa = uncorrelated errors = strong epistemic independence
   - Weight convergence by independence: agreement between low-kappa pairs is stronger evidence

3. **Convergence analysis**:
   - For each claim, count how many runtimes produced a verdict
   - Group by N runtimes agreeing (1, 2, 3, 4...)
   - Compute accuracy for each group
   - Test: does accuracy increase with N?

4. **Verdict-dependent convergence**:
   - Group by specific verdict (SUPPORTED, CONTRADICTED, etc.)
   - Some verdicts may converge more reliably than others

### Phase 5: Adjudication (Human)

**Goal**: Examine divergences to determine ground truth corrections and
catalog systematic biases.

1. **Divergence investigation**:
   - When runtimes disagree, is the ground truth wrong, or is one runtime wrong?
   - Ground truth corrections feed back into the corpus (bidirectional improvement)
   - Document the correction with evidence

2. **Bias profiling**:
   - For each runtime, identify systematic verdict flips (e.g., always assigns SUPPORTED when expected is PARTIALLY_SUPPORTED)
   - Catalog as capability profiles: "Runtime X has a tendency to Y"
   - These profiles inform future runtime selection

3. **Universal failures**:
   - Cases where ALL runtimes fail suggest corpus issues, not runtime issues
   - Investigate whether ground truth needs correction

## Key Findings from First Run (2026-08-11)

### Convergence predicts correctness

| N runtimes agree | Accuracy |
|-----------------|----------|
| 1 | 66.7% |
| 2 | 50.0% |
| 3 | **97.0%** |
| 4 | **100.0%** |

**30 percentage point improvement** from single-runtime to cross-runtime
convergence (N>=2: 96.7%, N=4: 100%).

### Error correlation varies by model family

| Pair | Cohen's kappa | Independence |
|------|--------------|-------------|
| MiniMax ↔ opencode | 0.165 | **Most independent** |
| DeepSeek ↔ Nemotron | 0.840 | Least independent (shared priors) |

Convergence between low-kappa pairs is stronger evidence than convergence
between high-kappa pairs.

### Each runtime has distinct biases

- **opencode (GLM-5.2)**: Overgenerous SUPPORTED, conflates UNVERIFIABLE with CONTRADICTED
- **DeepSeek V4 Flash**: Aggressive CONTRADICTED, flips UNVERIFIABLE to SUPPORTED
- **MiniMax M3**: Most conservative (zero false support), severe extraction failure
- **Nemotron-3-Ultra**: Most balanced (8/10 gates), shares DeepSeek's UNVERIFIABLE→SUPPORTED bias

## Implementation

### Files

Implementation lives in `claim-verify/eval/` (shared infrastructure). This
skill's `eval/` directory contains thin wrappers that delegate to it.

| File | Location | Purpose |
|------|----------|---------|
| `cross_runtime_harness.py` | `claim-verify/eval/` | Runtime-agnostic eval harness with adapters (opencode, NVIDIA NIM, Devin) |
| `score_all_runtimes.py` | `claim-verify/eval/` | Batch scoring against ground truth |
| `cross_runtime_analysis.py` | `claim-verify/eval/` | Capability matrix, error correlation, convergence analysis |
| `ab_blinding_test.py` | `claim-verify/eval/` | A/B comparison: blinded vs unblinded prompts |
| `smoke_test_all_nvidia.py` | `claim-verify/eval/` | Smoke test all NVIDIA NIM models for availability |
| `corpus/case_*.json` | `claim-verify/eval/corpus/` | 11 test cases with 92 ground-truth claims |
| `results/` | `claim-verify/eval/results/` | Per-runtime results, scored outputs, analysis |

### Running the protocol

```bash
# 1. Set API key
export NVIDIA_API_KEY="nvapi-..."

# 2. Smoke test available models
python smoke_test_all_nvidia.py

# 3. Run eval for each runtime
python cross_runtime_harness.py --runtime opencode
python cross_runtime_harness.py --runtime nvidia --model meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct

# 4. Score all results
python score_all_runtimes.py

# 5. Analyze convergence
python cross_runtime_analysis.py

# 6. (Optional) A/B blinding test
python ab_blinding_test.py --models "meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct" "nvidia/nemotron-3-ultra-550b"
```

### Adding a new runtime

Implement the `RuntimeAdapter` protocol in `cross_runtime_harness.py`:

```python
class MyAdapter:
    @property
    def name(self) -> str: return "my-runtime"
    @property
    def has_web_search(self) -> bool: return False
    def run_case(self, prompt: str, timeout: int = 300) -> dict:
        # Return {"success": bool, "text_response": str, ...}
        ...
```

Then add it to the `--runtime` options in the harness CLI.

## Skill Chains
- For additional free-tier runtimes for cross-validation -> `[reasoning-router]` (`python ~/bin/reasoning_router.py providers`)

### Mandatory
- None — this is a terminal evaluation skill

### Advisory
- **Before**: `[claim-verify]` — to build the corpus (extract claims, create ground truth)
- **After**: `[evidence-grade]` — to grade the quality of evidence in the convergence analysis
- **After**: `[agent-compare]` — for side-by-side comparison of specific runtime outputs
- **Execution**: `[cross-runtime-bridge]` — to delegate tasks to opencode runtime via `python ~/bin/cross_runtime_bridge.py delegate "<claim>"`

## Authority

- **T1 (TRUSTED)**: Full access — design, run, score, adjudicate
- **T2 (Active/High)**: Full access — evaluation is read-only on fleet state
- **T3 (Medium)**: May run and score; adjudication requires operator review
- **T4 (Probationary)**: Read-only — may view results, not run new evals

## Limitations

1. **Corpus size**: 11 cases / 92 claims is small. Statistical significance is
   limited. Expanding to 50+ cases would strengthen findings.
2. **Model families**: 4 runtimes across 4 model families. Adding more families
   (GPT-OSS, Gemma, Mistral, Qwen) would increase epistemic diversity.
3. **No web search for NVIDIA models**: The 3 NVIDIA runtimes operate in
   inference-only mode. opencode has web search, creating an asymmetry. A
   fair comparison would require either all-web or all-no-web.
4. **Ground truth is human-authored**: The corpus ground truth was created by
   a single human. Errors in ground truth would systematically bias all
   scoring. The adjudication phase (Phase 5) is designed to catch these.
5. **No formal blinding protocol**: Currently "blind-ish" (strip ground truth,
   inline instructions). A formal blinding protocol would include entity
   replacement and controlled unblinding (A/B comparison).
