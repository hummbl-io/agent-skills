# Offer Letter

Generate a complete employment offer letter for a new hire.

## When to Use

- Making any job offer (full-time, part-time, exempt, non-exempt)
- Formalizing a verbal offer in writing
- Equity-bearing offers (early-stage hires, key hires)
- Before the candidate's first day — offer letter is the legal record of agreed terms

## Offer Letter Structure

1. **Opening** — warm, specific to the candidate's contributions
2. **Position details** — title, status (exempt/non-exempt), manager, start date
3. **Compensation** — base salary, pay frequency, overtime policy if non-exempt
4. **Equity** — plain-English explanation of grant (ISO/NSO, count, vesting, exercise price pending 409A valuation, cliff, window)
5. **Benefits** — health, 401k, PTO, any perks
6. **At-will statement** — clearly stated for all US jurisdictions
7. **Conditions** — background check, I-9 authorization, NDAs/IP agreements to sign Day 1
8. **Expiration** — offer expires in 5 business days (default)
9. **Signature block** — founder signature + candidate acceptance line

## Equity Section (Plain English)

For any equity-bearing offer, the agent includes:

> "You will receive a stock option grant of [X] shares at an exercise price to be set by our board following a 409A valuation. Options vest over 4 years with a 1-year cliff: 25% vests after your first anniversary and the remaining 75% vests monthly over the following 36 months. Options are subject to the terms of our Stock Option Plan and your option agreement, which you will receive separately."

## Human Cost Equivalent

- Simple offer letter: $100-200 attorney or HR consultant time
- Equity-bearing offer letter: $200-400

## Skill Chains

- Offer accepted → `[contractor-agreement]` (if reclassifying as contractor instead)
- Offer accepted → send via `[send-email]`
- Day 1 → `[onboard-human]` (onboarding workflow)
- Equity offer → flag: need 409A valuation before options can be priced
