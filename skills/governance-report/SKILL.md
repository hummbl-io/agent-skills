# Governance Report

Periodic governance health report suitable for executive presentation. Tracks control implementation progress, risk trends, incident summary, and compliance posture. Recurring deliverable for governance consulting engagements.

## When to Use
- Monthly/quarterly client reporting
- Board-level governance updates
- Internal governance health check
- When user says "governance report" or "board report"

## Report Sections

### For Board/Leadership
1. **Executive Summary** (1 paragraph)
2. **Compliance Scorecard** (traffic lights per framework)
3. **Risk Posture** (trending up/down/stable)
4. **Key Metrics** (3-5 numbers that matter)
5. **Incidents** (summary, not detail)
6. **Recommendations** (2-3 actions)

### For Technical Audience
All of the above, plus:
7. **Control Implementation Status** (detailed table)
8. **Gap Closure Progress** (from remediation plan)
9. **Audit Findings** (if applicable)
10. **Technical Recommendations**

## Execution

1. **Gather data**: Control catalog, gap analysis, incident log, metrics
2. **Compute trends**: Compare to previous period
3. **Score compliance**: Per-framework percentage
4. **Draft narrative**: Highlight changes, risks, wins
5. **Format for audience**: Board (2 pages) vs technical (5-10 pages)

## Skill Chains

### Mandatory

- None — governance-report is `advisory` mode (generates report documents).

### Advisory

| After this skill... | Consider... |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Report drafted | `[exec-summary]` (if needs condensing) |
| For email delivery | `[send-email]` (send to client, with `[content-review]` passed) |
| Trends negative | `[risk-register]` (update risks) |
| Engagement renewal | `[renewal-check]` (is contract ending?) |
| Metrics improved | `[case-study]` (capture as success story) |

## Authority

- **T1 (TRUSTED)**: May run without restriction
- **T2 (Active/High)**: May run without restriction (advisory — generates report docs)
- **T3 (Medium)**: May run without restriction (advisory — generates report docs)
- **T4 (Probationary)**: May run (advisory — no side effects beyond file generation)
- **Operator**: Override any restriction
