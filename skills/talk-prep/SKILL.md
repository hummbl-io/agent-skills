# Talk Prep

Prepare a complete conference talk package: abstract for submission, slide outline with timing per section, speaker notes, and audience engagement points. Calibrated to talk length.

## When to Use
- You are preparing a conference talk or meetup presentation
- You need a structured abstract for a CFP (Call for Papers) submission
- You want slide-by-slide speaker notes with timing guidance
- You need to rehearse and want a timing checklist

## Execution
1. Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for topic, talk length (default 20 min), and optional event name
2. Draft a 150-word abstract suitable for CFP submission
3. Create slide outline with estimated time per section
4. Allocate time: 10% intro, 70% content (3-5 sections), 10% demo/examples, 10% Q&A
5. Write speaker notes for each slide (2-3 key points per slide)
6. Identify audience engagement moments (questions, live polls, demos)
7. List technical requirements (projector, internet, demo machine)
8. Present the complete talk package
